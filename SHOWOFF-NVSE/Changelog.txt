This file is here just so I'm reminded to keep track of changes as I do em.


//===v1.00 - too lazy to add right now

//===v1.05 - same deal


//===v1.10

-Semi-major refactorings (file inclusion was changed around, behaviors hopefully shouldn't change)
-Fixed GetCalculatedEquippedWeight and GetBaseEquippedWeight expecting an int "minWeight" instead of a float.
-GetCalculatedEquippedWeight - Fixed nullptr issue (caused crashes if no weapon was equipped)
-GetCalculatedEquippedWeight - Fixed "Modify Light Items" adjustement not being calculated per-reference (used to only care about if the player had the effect)
-For GetCalculatedEquippedWeight / GetBaseEquippedWeight / GetNumBrokenEquippedItems:
	*Fixed items being counted multiple times if they had multiple equip slots.
	*Added two new flags: skipUnplayable and noQuestItems
	*DEFAULT BEHAVIOR CHANGED: In order to avoid including unplayable items like the pipboy by default-calling the function, 
		`skipUnplayable` is automatically checked if Flags == 0 (or not provided).
		(This also applies to the new GetEquippedItems/UnequipItems functions)

-New Functions:
* SetShowOffDebugMode
* GetShowOffDebugMode
* UnequipItems
* GetEquippedItems
* IsBaseForm
* SetRandomizerSeed
* SetSeedUsingForm
* GetRandomizerSeed
* RandSeeded
* GetRandomPercentSeeded
* IsReferenceCloned
* AdvanceSeed

//===v1.15

===Misc:
* When the game starts, there is now a console print that says if ShowOff is running and what version it's at.
* Optimized GetEquipped__ functions.

===DEFAULT BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
*GetEquipped__ functions now account for items that have no equip slots (I didn't realize they could be equipped), no matter what the equip slot filters are.
In order to filter those out, there is now a new flag: NoSlotlessItems

===Bug Fixes:
* Fixed certain GetEquipped__ functions always printing to console
* Add RandSeeded safety check (Min must be <= Max) - before, breaking this assertion caused a crash. Returns -1 if this assertion fails.
* Fix GetRandomizerSeed returning NAN (returns -1 for errors now).

===New Functions:
* IsTemporaryReference - this should be kept undocumented, I didn't sufficiently test it.
* GetPCHasScriptedFastTravelOverride
* GetPCCanFastTravel
* WeaponHasFlag
* ActorHasBaseFlag
* RemoveAllItemsShowOff


//===v1.17

===New Functions:
* ForceWeaponJamAnim

//===v1.20

===Bug Fixes:
* ToggleQuestMessages now also silences quest objective messages.
* GetLevelUpMenuPoints now accounts for iLevelsPerPerk gamesetting (and skipping getting perks each level or so). Thanks Stewie!

* GetCalculatedPerkPoints
* GetLevelUpMenuCurrentPage
* SetLevelUpMenuCurrentPage
* ShowPerkMenu

//===v1.30

===Bug Fixes:
*Fix conflict with Stewie's Tweaks that broke bNoCrippleCriticalMessages=1 + g_bPatchCripple=1. 

===New Functions:
*Get/SetIngestibleConsumeSound
*SetFactionCombatReactionTemp
- The above is still registered, but was split in two for readability:
	*SetAllyTemp (alias: SetAllyShowOff)
	*SetEnemyTemp (alias: SetEnemyShowOff)
*GetEquippedItemRefForItem
*TopicInfoGet/SetResponseStrings
*(WIP functions from last update are still not done, sorry!)

* Added aliases for the INI functions.
* JSON functions will give better error messages.

===Bug Fixes:
* ShowPerkMenu:

- Copied code from Tweaks to force the perk menu to open even if not on a perk level (allows previewing perks).

===Function changes:
* Allow passing a formlist of items for GetEquippedItemRefForItem


//===v1.55

===Bug Fixes:
* Fixed GetIngestibleConsumeSound causing a crash if the ingestible has no consume sound.

* Fixed GetEquippedItemRefForItem not working properly with formlists.

===New Functions:

* AuxTimerStop
* AuxTimerPaused

* A couple of SO's item functions should now run faster, thanks to lStewieAl fixing the abuse of the slow DYNAMIC_CAST function.

===New Events:
* "ShowOff:OnReadBook"
* "ShowOff:OnDispositionChange"
* "ShowOff:OnAdd"

//===v1.65
===Bug Fixes:
* Fix innacurate projectile position in OnProjectileImpact/Destroy.
* Fix IsGamePaused check for AuxTimers
* Fixed GetEquippedItemRefForItem's return type (niche issue)
* Fix IsWeaponMelee/IsWeaponRanged requiring a calling ref

===New Functions:

* IsBlockingOrAiming
* SetOnAuxTimerUpdateHandler
* SetItemHotkeyIconPath
* GetItemHotkeyIconPath
* GetExplosionHitDamage
* SetExplosionHitDamage
* IsJumping

===New Events:
* "ShowOff:OnPreProjectileExplode"
* "ShowOff:OnPreRemoveItemFromMenu"

//===v1.71

===Event changes:
* "ShowOff:OnPreActivate" now runs before NVSE's "OnActivate" event, so preventing an activation in PreActivate will prevent "OnActivate" from running for that instance.

===General changes:
* Hook conflicts are now much more visible with the addition of an error msg box that will appear only once if an error is detected. Should help with error reporting.

//===v1.72

===Bug Fixes:
* Hook conflict message is now just a console print; should no longer accidentally crash the game for some users.
* Fixed a hook conflict with Tweaks at 0x88C65C (it partially broke my "ShowOff:OnPreActivateInventoryItem" event for special activations)
* Fixed bad hook conflict detection for 0x785087. This caused the hook to not install, causing an insane amount of perk points to be available in the perk menu.
* I didn't get around to fixing all reported hook conflicts, so expect another update soon.

//===v1.73

===Bug Fixes:
* Hook conflicts w/ NVAC at 0x780648 & 0x701FAE should now be resolved
* Fixed crash by delaying hook conflict console print if hook conflict was detected right as the plugin is loading in (i.e before console is even loaded).

//===v1.74

===Bug Fixes:
* Resolved hook conflict w/ NVAC at 0x5EC5DC 
* Fixed ToggleQuestMessages, which got broken by faulty hook conflict checks at 0x76BADC, 0x76BAEB, 0x76BAAC and 0x76BABB since v1.71
* Fixed breaking the first arg passed to the NVSE OnActivate event due to changes in 1.71. This probably broke a lot of mods relying on that event, now fixed.

===New Functions:
* GetCalculatedActorSpread


//===v1.75

===Bug Fixes:
* Fixed GetCalculatedActorSpread always returning 1 due to faulty IsWeaponOut check
* Fixed ObjectiveCompleted/Displayed freezing the game with NVAC, due to bug in v1.74's NVAC hook conflict resolution


//===v1.80
